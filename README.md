# DataScience
This Repository presents my data science project on the Health Brazilian Public System.  
As I am very interested in Python and also in R, sometimes I use a mix of them.  It allows me to take the benefit of many Python packages combined with R graphical elegance.
Most of the content is written in Brazilian Portuguese, as I use it in my LinkedIn article for data science popularization, available on https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analisando-dados-de-exames-preventivos-do-sus-com-r-e-amanda/
