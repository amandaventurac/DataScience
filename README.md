# DataScience
This Repository presents some of my data science projects.
As I am very interested in Python and also in R, sometimes I use a mix of them. 
These projects allow me to take the benefit of many Python packages combined with R graphical elegance.
Some content is written in Brazilian Portuguese, as it is also used in my LinkedIn articles for science popularization.
